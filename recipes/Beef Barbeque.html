    <p>Beef short ribs are a highly flavorful cut; this method of cooking makes the meat so tender you won't need a knife. The thick rich sauce is delicious served with mashed potatoes and the carrots that cook with the ribs.</p>

    <h2>Ingredient List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>5 pounds lean beef short ribs, cut into 3-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon fresh ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 large onion, cut into thick slices and separated into rings</li>
        <li>5 carrots, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup barbeque sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat oil over medium heat in a large, heavy, oven-safe pot or Dutch oven, and brown the ribs on all sides, about 5 minutes, working in batches if necessary. Sprinkle ribs with salt and black pepper as they brown. Transfer cooked ribs to paper towels to blot up extra oil.</li>
        <li>Stir the onion rings and carrots into the same pot, and cook and stir until the onions turn translucent and start to brown, about 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 1 more minute. Mix in tomato sauce, barbeque sauce, and beef broth; bring the sauce to a boil, and simmer for 1 minute to blend flavors. Stir in the browned ribs.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot, and bake in the preheated oven until the rib meat is very tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Turn the ribs occasionally while cooking. Season to taste with salt and black pepper before serving hot.</li>
    </ol>
